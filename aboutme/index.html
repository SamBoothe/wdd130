    <p>Hi! I am super excited to be in this class! I don't know a lot about 
        programming or creating websites, but I am ready to learn!</p>
    <p>My wife, Amanda, and I have been married for 11 years and we have 3 
        beautiful girls. To say I have my hands full is an understatement, 
        as they are all very active! We also have a fur-baby, Chloe, who is 
        our little black house-panther. I am very outnumbered.</p>
    <p>I decided to pursue a degree in Applied Technology because it is 
        something I know very little about. That might not have been the 
        best way to decide, but it seemed more exciting than a business 
        degree. I really enjoyed the challenge my programming course was last 
        semester and anticipate this class challenging me as well. I do plan 
        to find a career in Computer Science, possibly even computer 
        programming itself. I love learning, and love solving problems. </p>
