        <p> This mode involves the use of special cards that offer a twist in the original gameplay. Three cards
            are drawn initially, one from the Deployment deck, one from the Objectives deck, and one from the
            Twists deck. There are two other decks that can be used if specific circumstances are met, those are
            the Ruse and the Sudden Death decks. These last two are only used if your opponent has a larger army
            than your own. This mode is a very fun way to play different missions than what is in the core rule
            book or any of the other supplements that have been published.
        </p>

    <div id="Narrative" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Narrative Play</h3>
        <p> This is an organized campaign that allows players to build their army as the army grows within the
            campaign. This is a fun way to get to know players of every level, from the most experienced to the
            newest of players.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Tournament" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Matched Play</h3>
        <p> This mode encompasses tournaments and any other organized method of play. This mode is for more
            serious players, those that want a more structured game play with specific missions and rules. This
            can be fun, especially if the opponent is good natured.
