                <h2 class="info-heading">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your
                    safety,
                    our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting
                    experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                </p>
                <p>Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
                    device
                    (PFD). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in
                    depth and
                    engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do if you
                    fall out
                    of the raft.

                <h2 class="info-heading">Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                <img class="kids-rafting" src="images/Rafting_with_Kids.jpg" alt="rafting with kids">
                <p class="info-text1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the
                    age of
                    8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over
                    8). A
                    common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at
                    a time.
                    Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are
                    some of
                    the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to
                    mention the
                    rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been
                    proven
                    that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are
                    even
                    true!

                <h2 class="info-heading">What is included in the trip?</h2>
                <p>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, a foam pad, a
                    waterproof
                    duffle bag, a small waterproof day bag, a tent, a cot, eating utensils and a camping chair.
                </p>
                <p>We provided water and lemonade during the day, as well as 3 meals and snacks! Coffee, tea, and hot
                    chocolate
                    are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor, and soft drinks (in
                    reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip,
                    or on
                    your way to the “put-in”.

                <h2 class="info-heading">What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared
                    for both hot & dry and cold & wet.
                </p>
                <p>Rain jacket and rain pants: do not bring ponchos.</p>
                <p>Quick dry shirts and shorts: long sleeve cotton shirt and pants help keep you cooler on hot days.
                    Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck.</p>
                <p>Light weight cotton or nylon pants: the best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts. If you
                    are cold natured, bring polypropylene long-underwear for the top and bottom. Women typically wear
                    swimsuits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, 
                    wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton 
                    if you are hot). Two-piece swimsuits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom.</p>
                <p>Hat: a large-brim hat offers protection from the sun. Make sure it has a good quality strap.</p>
                <p>Sunglasses: also with a strap.</p>
                <p>Socks: used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. Bring an extra dry pair for cold nights.</p>
                <p>Sandals or water shoes: if you are not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked
                    in before.</p>
                <p>Camper wear: bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are
                    all popular options.</p>
                <p>Sleep wear: you might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring
                    something comfortable to sleep in.</p>
                <p>Water bottle or moleskin.</p>
                <p>Small day pack for hikes.</p>
                <p>Moisturizing lotion.</p>
                <p>Headlamp or flashlight.</p>
                <p>Waterproof sunscreen and lip balm.</p>
                <p>Optional items: gloves, a fleece jacket, towel or sarong, a bandana, or a small pillow.
                    Hygiene products: toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra
                    eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo, camera equipment, a book or cards, a journal and a pen.

                <p class="info-text2-1">Are you kidding me?! What's not great about whitewater rafting?! ... Let's describe a common day on
                    the
                    river:</p>
                <p class="info-text2-2">Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry
                    sky. Have
                    a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and
                    prepare
                    for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history,
                    geology,
                    stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can
                    relax with
                    a good book or good company by the river or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
                    dinner.
                    Something like steak and potatoes or grilled salmon, perhaps? Oh! And dutch oven brownies! You won't
                    forget
                    the dutch oven brownies! After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your
                    guide into
                    another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.

                <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more
                    flexible 6
                    months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
