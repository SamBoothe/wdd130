                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> Warhammer 40000, and all the various iterations of the game, is published by Games Workshop. Based out of the UK, they have become a world-wide phenomenon with shops located in many cities across the world. The first thing you should understand is there have been 9 editions since 1987. Back then, the game was called “Rogue Trader” and the rules were closer to a Table-Top Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) similar to Dungeons and Dragons than the table-top wargame it transformed into later. There were less constraints about weapon choices, vehicles loadouts, or armies available to players. Perhaps one of the biggest changes would be the use of a Game Master (GM). New editions do not require any such figure, though it is not against any written rules. Many of the armies available to players now were not featured until later editions, instead they had other armies that faded out as the years progressed. Armies like the “Squats”, dwarf-like humanoids known for being tough and wild, or “Slann”, amphibius humanoids that featured more in the fantasy editions when Game Workshop decided to split their “40k” universe from the more fantasy universe.

                <h2>Modern Day</h2>
                <p> The most recent edition, released in July 2020, is the 9th iteration of the popular table-top wargame. The armies have changed over the years and currently include Astra Militarum, several Space Marine and Chaos Space Marine factions, Daemon armies, robotic Necrons, insectoid Tyranids, Orks, and a number of elvish Aeldari. These can be summed up into 4 main factions: Space Marines, Armies of the Imperium, Armies of Chaos, and the Xenos Armies.
