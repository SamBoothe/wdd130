                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> Warhammer 40000, and all the various iterations of the game, is published by Games Workshop. Based out of the UK, they have become a world-wide phenomenon with shops located in many cities across the world. The first thing you should understand is there have been 9 editions since 1987. Back then, the game was called “Rogue Trader” and the rules were closer to a Role-Playing Game (RPG) than the table-top wargame it transformed into later. There were less constraints about weapon choices, vehicles loadouts, or armies available to players. Perhaps one of the biggest changes would be the use of a Game Master (GM). New editions do not require any such figure, though it is not against any written rules. Many of the armies available to players now were not featured until later editions, instead they had other armies that faded out as the years progressed. Armies like the “Squats”, dwarf-like humanoids known for being tough and wild, or “Slann”, amphibius humanoids that featured more in the fantasy editions when Game Workshop decided to split their “40k” universe from the more fantasy universe.

                <p> The most recent edition.
                    Wording will include armies available in the newest edition of the game. I am still working on getting content for this section.
